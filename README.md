# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application written in HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript to visualize different sorting algorithms.

The algorithms visualized here are comparison-based. I chose to visualize five different sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort  
2. Insertion Sort  
3. Merge Sort  
4. Quick Sort  
5. Heap Sort

## ⚙️ Details
All algorithms except **Merge Sort** use **O(1) auxiliary space**, meaning no additional memory is required and elements are swapped in place until the array is sorted in ascending order.

**Quick Sort** uses **O(log n)** space due to recursion.

You can also adjust the **frames per second** even while the algorithm is running to control the animation speed.
